Sounds are vibrations that flow in the form of a soundwave through a medium (air, water,
steel, etc.). The sound wave is made up of air pressurechanges caused by the movement of
air molecules back and forth.These variations inair pressure are referred to as vibrations,
and they can be detected using a number of sensors.These variations in air pressure are
referred to as vibrations, and they can be detectedusing a number of sensors.

The sensor era has arrived. Dr. Janusz Bryzek, formerVP Development of MEMS and Sensing
Solutions at Fairchild Semiconductor, has stated thatby 2022, there would be one trillion
sensors in use. According to Gartner, there willbe 20 billion connected things in operation
worldwide by 2020, with the majority of them containingseveral sensors.

Sensors are significant because they collect a largeamount of data that can be analyzed
and interpreted to improve productivity, security,predict risks, and improve people's lives. In
simple words, sensors can be used to impart intelligenceinto machines and systems and
give birth to countless applications in various fields.

When this ability to analyze and interpret data inreal-time is amalgamated with
microcontrollers and microprocessors, we get intelligentsystems with wide-ranging
applications in various parts of life. In this project,I have implemented two rudimentary sound
detection systems which use the Arduino microcontrollerboard and the KY-037 sound
sensing module.
